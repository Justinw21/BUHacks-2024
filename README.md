# RotReset

## Inspiration

In today's fast-paced world, mental health often takes a backseat to our daily responsibilities. Inspired by the engaging and motivational aspects of apps, we wanted to create a platform that prioritizes mental well-being through interactive and progressively challenging activities. Our goal was to develop an app that not only tracks mood but also encourages users to build healthy habits and maintain consistency in their self-care routines.

## What It Does

RotReset is a mental health-focused app designed to help users track their mood and engage in activities that promote well-being. Key features include:

- **Personalized Activities**: Users can participate in challenges like breathing exercises, yoga, stretches, walks, and randomized tasks that progressively increase in difficulty.
- **Time-Based Suggestions**: The app asks users how much time they have and suggests activities that fit their schedule.
- **Streak Development**: Encourages users to build and maintain streaks, fostering consistency in their mental health practices.
- **Mood Tracking**: Incorporates a notes section and a rating system using emojis to allow users to express how they feel after each activity.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Users can track their achievements, earn badges, and see how long they've been consistently engaging with the app.
- **Social Interaction**: Allows users to add friends, fostering a community of support and motivation.

## How We Built It

- **Frontend**:
  - **Framework**: React for building a dynamic user interface.
  - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for efficient and responsive design.
  - **UI Components**: Shadcn for a consistent and accessible component library.

- **Backend**:

  - **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability.

- **Database**:
